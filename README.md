Boxteroids - Shoot Boxes in Space!
==================================

Up to this point I've only been writing plugins for UE4, and it's about time I've actually used
UE4 to build something (after all, I'm the one paying the subscription, not the other way around :P).
I'm going to be keeping things as simple as I can on the art side, so I don't get sucked into 
writing a Blender addon or another plugin.

This repository will only contain the C++ source for the game, Blueprints and other assets will be 
stored in a private repository. Binary releases will be provided through this public repository,
and I may put up an archive with all the source assets for each release as well.
